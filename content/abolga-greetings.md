##### COMPLIMENT OF THE SEASON FROM GODSGIFT THANKGOD AKARI.

**MERRY CHRISTMAS My good People of Abua/Odual.**

As we celebrate the birth of Christ today, I wish You all a Christmas filled with harmony and tranquility as we put our eyes on the path ahead which is more glorious, brighter and better than the ugly past.

I pray we find a way in our hearts to forgive all those that have trespassed against us. undisputedly; Jesus the reason for the celebration is not just merely an example of forgiveness, He is the source of our forgiveness. So I beseech all Abolgans to see this celebration as an opportunity to build bridges, an opportunity to correct wrongs, forgive and show love to one another, because our strength will for ever lie in our unity.

Christmas as we all know, is an annual festival observed by Christians around the world; commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ who symbolizes love and a new beginning. He's the very personification of Divinity whom birth dawned a new era for the world. Jesus Christ was born at a time when purity was forgotten and morality was neglected, a time when superstition, hatred, ignorance, hypocrisy and greed prevailed upon the land.

**Abua/Odual a Local Government in Rivers State**, is facing its own fair or unfair share of national and global challenges, that are overwhelming even other LGA's in the State. But if we can stand together as a people, and fight together, we shall overcome the storms, because greater is he that is with us than he that is with our enemies, and certainly; together our foes are surmountable. Division of any form is not the solution to our problem as some tribes and regions believe.

The preachings and agitations for peace, unity and development of our dear land, is not about an individual, not about a group of people, it is not about any religion, it is not about an individual, it is not about a fight for the elites with respected positions only; but it's all about our dear nation and our collective responsibility.

How can we comfort those orphaned by senseless killings carried out by those who donâ€™t have respect for the sanctity of life? a question for all of us. For me! No amount of compensation will fill the vacuum created in the hearts of the victims who always keep vigil, expecting the return of their love ones that will never return by virtue of the circumstances beyond their control.

Pride, oppression, disunity, selfishness, self centeredness, backbiting and black faming, has caused us as a people more agony, hatred, underdevelopment and more regrets than good. We pursue elusive things of life and allow them decide and destroy our future leaving less hope for the fate of posterity. We buy and build gigantic houses, become business tycoons, live affluent lives with family members, establish businesses abroad, in other areas of the country and here in Rivers state at the detriment of the development of our dear land, which is the greatest asset we inherited from our forefathers. All of which are vanity upon vanity.

Furthermore; as born again Christians that most persons may claim to be. It's so sad and regrettable that even in the church, we frequently sin against one another as we live and worship together. We've not always been loved well by others, each of us has been hurt, sometimes grievously. And so, amid the commands to welcome, serve, encourage, and love one another, we receive a command for when our brothers, sisters and love ones fail us in those very things we hold so dearly.

The only way, and the fastest way to grow as a people and change our narrative, is to help one another, discover potentials in our youths and build them, unity is key to development.
May the spirit of brotherhood abide in us as we celebrate this day and cheer with love ones.

**MERRY CHRISTMAS ONES MORE, AS I WISH US ALL, A PROSPEROUS NEW YEAR IN ADVANCE.**
